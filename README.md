# Person Finder [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/google/personfinder.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/google/personfinder)

Person Finder is a searchable missing person database written in Python and
hosted on App Engine.

Person Finder implements the PFIF data model and provides PFIF import and export
as well as PFIF Atom feeds. It was initially created by Google volunteers in
response to the Haiti earthquake in January 2010, and today contains
contributions from many volunteers inside and outside of Google. It was used
again for the earthquakes in Chile, Yushu, and Japan, and now runs at
http://google.org/personfinder/.
