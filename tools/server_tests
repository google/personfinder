# Both production App Engine and dev_appserver run in the UTC timezone.
# However, the App Engine SDK uses datetime.now(), not datetime.utcnow().  
# This means that auto_now properties will get local times when written by
# server_tests.py, but UTC times when written by the dev_appserver.  So,
# to make tests work properly, we have to set the local time zone to UTC.
